During the fall semester of 2018, I took a class at Washtenaw Community College called _Web Programming Using Apache, MySQL, and PHP_. For the final project, we were given the skeleton for a MVC web app designed to track the user's freelancing jobs.

The web app features a MySQL backend that stores all the data and the relationships between jobs, accounts, and contacts.

This was my first PHP project and the first project I took an existing codebase and heavily added to it. This required a lot of debugging skills and a deep understanding of the prexisting design patterns of the code.
