## Trans Together

Founded in August 2018, Trans Together is a monthly social+art meetup I created for transgender people that meets in the gallery space of Riverside Arts Center in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The mission of the group is to provide a space where some of our most vulnerable community members can feel safe enough to fully express themselves and  form community with other transgender people.
