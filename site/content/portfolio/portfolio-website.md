**You are here!** This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in `go`. No themes are loaded which means all the structure and design is my own. I constructed the view/layout templates with `go`'s amazing [templating language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). The CSS features modern design without relying on a framework by leveraging `flexbox`, gradients, animations, and more. All of the content is kept in `markdown` which makes editing easy.

Here's an example of some `markdown` this page is built with:
{{< highlight md >}}
